## Requirements
- Android 10 firmware for your device:
  - Redmi 7: https://xiaomifirmwareupdater.com/archive/miui/onclite/

## Files
- Download the latest fastbootable image: [droidian-UNOFFICIAL-phosh-phone-xiaomi_onclite-api28-arm64-nightly_XXXXXXXX.zip](https://github.com/droidian-onclite/droidian-images/releases/tag/nightly).

## Installation
* Extract the archive
* run the `flash_all` script
* Boot to fastboot and let the script flash everything.

## Notes
- The default password is `1234`.
- If you see a black screen, don't worry it takes a long time to boot.
- **Droidian GSIs are experimental! Bugs and missing features are expected.**

## Bugs
- Mobile data needs an APN to be set up from Settings -> Mobile -> Acess Point Names.
- Mobile data might stop working after making or recieving phone calls. Toggle Mobile Data from the settins off/on.
- Dual SIM functionality is currently not implemented in Phosh so only one SIM works at the moment.

## Final notes
- I'm not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed.
- Please do some research if you have any concerns about features included in the products you find here before flashing it!
- YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if you point the finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you.
