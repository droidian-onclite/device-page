## Requirements
- Android 10 firmware for your device:
  - Redmi 7: https://xiaomifirmwareupdater.com/archive/miui/onclite/

## Files
- Download the latest rootfs:  [droidian-OFFICIAL-phosh-phone-rootfs-api28-arm64-nightly_XXXXXXXX.zip](https://github.com/droidian-images/droidian/releases/tag/nightly).
- Download the adaptation package: [adaptation-droidian-onclite.zip](https://github.com/droidian-onclite/adaptation-droidian-onclite/releases/download/adaptation/adaptation-droidian-onclite.zip).

## Installation
- Flash your favorite recovery ( TWRP Recommended ).
- Format userdata as ext4 from inside the recovery or via fastboot: `fastboot format:ext4 userdata`.
- Now boot into recovery.
- Go into sideload mode and sideload adaptation-droidian-garden.zip: `adb sideload adaptation-droidian-onclite.zip`
- Go into sideload mode and sideload droidian-OFFICIAL-phosh-phone-rootfs-api29-arm64-nightly_XXXXXXXX.zip: `adb sideload droidian-OFFICIAL-phosh-phone-rootfs-api28-arm64-nightly_XXXXXXXX.zip`

- Now boot into your device.
- *The first boot will take a while.*

## Notes
- The default password is `1234`.
- If you see a black screen, don't worry it takes a long time to boot.
- **Droidian GSIs are experimental! Bugs and missing features are expected.**

## Bugs
- Mobile data needs an APN to be set up from Settings -> Mobile -> Acess Point Names.
- Mobile data might stop working after making or recieving phone calls. Toggle Mobile Data from the settins off/on.
- Dual SIM functionality is currently not implemented in Phosh so only one SIM works at the moment.
- Brightness can only be adjusted via the applet on the appdrawer.

## Final notes
- I'm not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed.
- Please do some research if you have any concerns about features included in the products you find here before flashing it!
- YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if you point the finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you.
